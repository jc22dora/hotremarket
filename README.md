# hotremarket

HotREMarkets is a web app I developed to work on my front end skills, analytical skills by posting ad-hoc analyses on particularly interesting zip codes, experimental statistics by trying new techniques to identify 'hot real estate markets' and provide general statistics to users who are curious. It has its own github because it is one of my bigger projects that i'm working on.
